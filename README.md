There are 3 functions in the project:
breakSen, makeUpper, main

Important thing to mention is that in function main the paths to the files in.txt and out.txt are specified.

These paths are only suitable for my computer.

For the program to work correctly with them, you will need to specify the path to these files on your personal computer.
