There are 3 functions in the project:
breakSen, makeUpper, main

Important thing to mention is that in function **main** the paths to the files in.txt and out.txt are specified.

C:\\Users\\user\\CLionProjects\\PSS2HW1\\out.txt	

C:\\Users\\user\\CLionProjects\\PSS2HW1\\in.txt

These paths are only suitable for my computer.

For the program to work correctly with them, you will need to specify the path to these files on your personal computer.

Another important thing is that if there are 2 or more words in the sentence that are match with words in the last line of input file output file consists of line:

Word **x** matched **n** time(s) in the sentence(s) below:

“Sentence”, where matched word 1st time

“Sentence”, where matched word 2nd time

And so on. However all of this mentioning will be uppercasted because it was not mentioned in the technical task 

At the worst, I zipped my project on Moodle
